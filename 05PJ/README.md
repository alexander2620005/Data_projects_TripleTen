# Turning Event Logs into Business Metrics

This project analyzes raw user activity data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights about user behavior, conversion funnels, and customer retention trends.

## 📌 Project Overview

Using event logs that track product views, cart additions, and purchases, we explored:

- How well users are converting at each stage of the funnel
- Monthly user acquisition and retention rates
- Trends in user engagement and lifetime value over time

## 📊 Key Findings

### 🔁 Conversion Funnel (From Views to Purchases)

- **Conversion from product views to cart:** 29.0%
- **Conversion from cart to purchase:** 35.6%
- **Overall conversion from view to purchase:** ~10.3%

These figures reveal a significant drop-off between browsing and adding to cart, indicating potential issues in product appeal or site UX.

### 📈 Cohort Retention Rates

- **Best retention cohort:** September 2020 (12.5% retained in month 1)
- Most cohorts show steep drop-off after the first month.
- Indicates need for re-engagement strategies after initial conversion.

### 🧠 Cohort Analysis

- User activity was segmented by first purchase month.
- Most new customers came during Q4 2020 (October to December).
- Retention dropped consistently from month 2 to 4 across all cohorts.
