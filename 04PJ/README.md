# 💼 Saving Superstore – Tableau Project

This project analyzes profitability and operational efficiency at the Superstore retail chain. As a consultant, my goal was to identify areas of high profit, major losses, advertising opportunities, and potential issues with product returns—ultimately guiding the business out of a financial crisis.
