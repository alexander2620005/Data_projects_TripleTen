# 📦 Superstore Returns Analysis – Tableau Project

This project analyzes the high rate of product returns in the Superstore retail chain using interactive dashboards built in Tableau. The objective was to identify root causes of returns and propose data-driven strategies to reduce return volume and improve customer satisfaction.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File:** Superstore.xls  
- **Tables used:** Orders, Returns, and Products

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify what is causing the high number of product returns.
- Explore patterns based on time, geography, shipping mode, and product category.
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce return rates.

## 📊 Key Visualizations & Findings

- **Return Rate by Shipping Mode:**  
  Same Day delivery showed the highest return rate, possibly due to rushed or inaccurate deliveries.

- **Total Sales vs. Total Returns by Product Subcategory:**  
  Some high-return items (e.g., Paper) need attention, while others like Chairs perform well with fewer returns.

- **Monthly Return Rate by Product Category:**  
  Categories like Office Supplies and Technology had spikes in August and September, suggesting seasonal effects.

- **Return Rate by State (Map):**  
  Utah had the highest return rate. The western U.S. displayed generally higher return levels than the east.

- **Return Rate by Month (Line Chart):**  
  Return rates peaked in August, September, and December, indicating seasonality.

## 📌 Dashboard Requirements Met

- Compare return rate and total returns across dimensions.
- Analyze returns by time (monthly), geography (state), and delivery mode.
- Contrast total returns vs total sales using scatterplots.
- Build multi-factor dashboards with tooltips and filters for better insight exploration.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **Shipping mode matters:** Faster isn’t always better if it causes more returns.
- **Product focus:** Items with high return volumes but low profit margins may need to be discontinued or improved.
- **Seasonality:** Return trends show consistent spikes during certain months—adjust inventory and marketing accordingly.
- **Geographic targeting:** Some regions consistently show higher return rates and may require operational review.
